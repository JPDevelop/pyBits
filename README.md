## the pybits library is very small but usefull and has 5 functions:

1. readBitsFromFile: Returns a two-dimensional list: in each byte 8 bits

2. readBitsFromText: Gets plain text and returns two-dimensional array of bits

3. getTextFromBytes: Gets bytes array and returns plain text

4. writeBytesToFile: Gets a file name and writes chars to it which are represented by Unicode

5. bits2bytes: Gets a two-dimensional list of bits and converts it into one-dimensional list of bytes
