# pyBits

## the pybits library is very small but usefull and has 5 functions:

1. readBitsFromFile: **_Returns a two-dimensional list: in each byte 8 bits_**

2. readBitsFromText: **_Gets plain text and returns two-dimensional array of bits_**

3. getTextFromBytes: **_Gets bytes array and returns plain text_**

4. writeBytesToFile: **_Gets a file name and writes chars to it which are represented by Unicode_**

5. bits2bytes: **_Gets a two-dimensional list of bits and converts it into one-dimensional list of bytes_**
